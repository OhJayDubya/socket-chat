# Socket Chat
Socket Chat is a simple demo application to showcase features of [socket.io](https://socket.io) to create a nice little multi-user chat room. Built with node and express on the server, and nothing more than vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS on the client side.

To run the application download the code and then route to it in the terminal of your choice and use:

```
npm install
```

Once everything is installed run:

```
npm run start
```

The application should then run on `localhost:3000` (If you want to change this go into the `index.js` file and change to a preferred port at the bottom of the file). Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser and enter your username first to enter the chat room. Open up another browser or private session and navigate to `localhost:3000` and you can begin talking to yourself!

Feel free to play around, use or modify the application till your hearts content!
